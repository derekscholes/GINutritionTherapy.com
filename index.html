        <p class="ps">These are all valid concerns that are the focus of this site. My hope for the future is to provide this information to the public and help resolve questions that need answers.</p>

        <p class="ps">Currently, there is very limited information on this site due to the relative age of the site as well as the time constraint I have while in medical school. The goal I have is to work on this little by little throughout the rest of my medical career.</p>
        <p class="ps">Please feel free to go to the "Contact Me" page to send me any question or request and I will do my best to get back to you in a timely manner to help answer any doubts or unsolved questions.</p>
