          Personal Statement
        </h2>
        <p class="ps">
          “I don’t believe you!” Hearing those words come out of my physician’s mouth made me realize what kind of physician I wanted to be. Receiving that rejection after having trusted him with my personal health shocked me so much that I never went back to that doctor. This experience didn’t deter me from my goal of becoming a physician. It did, however, solidify my goal to believe in my patients and attempt to understand them no matter their background.
        </p>
        <p class="ps">
          Before this experience, medicine was not a priority in my family: I had no family members in the healthcare field, and they often avoided contact with healthcare due to financial concerns or mistrust of doctors. What drew me to medicine was the opportunity to help those who didn’t have the money, trust, or understanding of the importance of regular health maintenance. I saw the difficulties that my grandma, who knew very little English, struggled with as she was undergoing treatment for breast cancer. I also witnessed the lack of understanding that my mom’s Spanish-speaking friends had about their medical conditions. All of this fueled my desire to aid such patients in their struggle and to help lessen the misunderstanding between them and their healthcare providers so that all could receive equal care and proper health education.

          Shortly after starting my undergraduate degree, I took a two-year leave of absence to pursue a volunteer opportunity as a religious missionary in the Mexico Tijuana Mission. During these two years, I spent my daily efforts serving the community in Tijuana, Mexico through religious lessons, construction projects, assisting in addiction recovery, promoting lifestyle changes, and improving the welfare of all who would accept my assistance. This service opportunity gave me experience in time management, leadership, and a focus on serving others. It also helped me learn more about Latino culture and how to best serve the Latin-American community, based on their capabilities and needs.

          Long before medical school I had the desire to help those with nutritional concerns, and this led me to become a dietitian. The specialty that caught my eye was gastroenterology, as I always loved treating patients with diseases of the gastrointestinal tract throughout my nutritional studies. Through this specialty, and my background, I can aid patients with intestinal disorders and nutritional concerns and participate in procedural practice to serve a diverse clientele. Another benefit is that I can also serve Latinos in a field severely lacking Latino providers. My long-term plan is to open a practice specializing in the medical and nutritional management of the gastrointestinal system that focuses on a multidisciplinary approach based on lifestyle.

          My most meaningful extracurricular activity started this year. It began with a web development course that required me to create a webpage as the final project. I originally thought of creating a professional site that contained a personal statement and CV, but over time the idea evolved into something more fulfilling and useful to the very people I love to serve. It became a website where I not only posted my professional documents, but also where I could post self-written, evidence-based articles that discuss nutritional therapy. I hope to eventually add discussions of nutritional and medical management for those with gastrointestinal disorders as well as telehealth opportunities as a starter to develop my practice.

          In recent years, my focus has primarily been on punctuality, dedication, respect, compassion, and leadership in all my dealings with patients and colleagues. I believe that these qualities are evident in my patients’ satisfaction, the evaluations I have received from residents and faculty, and my research. My greatest struggle has been managing my family responsibilities and applying these qualities at work. I now realize that integrating these into my everyday life and discussing priorities with my family has helped increase my ability to serve others while preventing personal and work conflict. In addition to this finding, my greatest accomplishment during medical school, beyond work/life balance, has been the addition of research participation that has expanded my understanding of colorectal cancer screening in Hispanics, as well as IBD treatment in the pediatric population. This wasn’t achieved through publication. Rather, it came about because of the information I had gained about gastrointestinal disorders, as well as health literacy based on cultural background.

          Based on these experiences, I believe that I would be a great fit for your internal medicine residency program. In addition to the above, my ability to communicate fully with patients who speak Spanish or Portuguese, my patient interview and leadership and management skills I’ve acquired in nutrition and dietetics, and my qualities of dedication and respect will allow me to be an important addition to your team.
