        <h3><a id="weight-loss">Weight Loss Management</a></h3>
        <p>One massive issue in our society isn't just obesity, but the difficulty individuals have in losing the excess weight. The purpose of this post is to help create a plan that is not only simple, but realistic. If followed, one can successfully lose weight. I do not create any sort of weight loss program or diet for others, but prefer the individual create it themselves. The following ideas are not to be used as a weight loss routine, but as an outline and resource to help one who wants to lose weight set their own goals and plan of action that is realistic for them. In advance, I do not offer consultations or further advice. I am not legally certified in any state to work in client counseling.</p>
        <p>Before you choose any certain route for weight reduction, I would like to emphasize that lifestyle changes should always come first when you want to lose weight. These changes should include both diet change and physical activity; however, if one of these cannot be done, stick with just doing the other.</p>
        <p>As you begin your weight loss journey, don't jump into the deep end without knowing what you are getting yourself into. This means, don't set goals that are beyond your capability. This is hard to achieve if you don't know where you currently stand on how you eat or how active you are. To find out this information, keep a food journal of what you eat and when and note down when you are physically active. If you do this for one week, you will see a routine start to unfold.</p>
        <p>Once you start to get to know your lifestyle a little better, this is when you can start to look at parts of you day that you can begin to change. It is important to not make too many changes at once, but small changes one by one. With all of this in mind, create a list of what can be improve! Trust me, you will find at least one. ;)</p>
        <p>Now, once you know your routine and have your list of routines or habits that can be changed, you are now ready to set a long term goal of where you want to be in 6 months to a year. For example, if I need to lose weight to help reduce my blood pressure, aim to lose 5 to 10% of your weight. So if I weight 200 pounds, I should only set a goal of losing 10 to 20 pounds between that 6 month to one year period.</p>
        <p>This brings me to the point of goal setting. One should always set goals that are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-based. You can use the acronym SMART goal to remember. This can be seen in the previous example I gave. I don't just want to lose weight, I want to lose a specific amount, let's say 10 pounds. This amount can be measured and should be achievable if I have enough time, which is about 6 months. This goal is relevant to me since I would need to lose the weight to help lower my blood pressure. As you can see, this goal contains each piece of the SMART goal.</p>
        <p>Once this long term goal is created, set up short term goals. I want to lose 2 pounds per month in order to lose my 10 pounds in six months. Once that is set, you must move on to your list of lifestyles you can change. Maybe I want to add walking for 30 minutes a day to my routine. That seems like something not too difficult. It might even help me get through an audio book or podcast I have meant to finish. </p>
        <p>Maybe I will start to use a smaller plate for meals to help reduce portion sizes. I can also drink a glass of water before meals. I might even be someone who needs to get rid of all my sweets to get rid of the temptation. I don't want you to think that to modify your diet means you have to follow a specific diet and cut out the "bad" foods. Change one thing at a time and soon, you will see that those small changes will add up to a complete change later on. Write down your plan and keep it somewhere that will remind you of what needs to be done. If you need, there are many books that can help you modify these daily habits and make them easier to start, complete, and repeat. Stick with it! You are capable if you just believe in yourself. Don't be too hard on yourself, because you want this to be a good experience.</p>
        <p>As time passes, if you have been able to set your plan to achieve your goals and you stick to it, you will see success! It doesn't matter if this success was small or large, as long as there is some sort of change!</p>
        <p>In summary, here is a list of what was discussed.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Step 1: Keep a diet and exercise journal for at least a week.</li>
          <li>Step 2: Make note of what eating habits and physical activity can be changed. Give yourself a few simple options!</li>
          <li>Step 3: Set a long-term goal</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Make sure it is SMART!</li>
              <ul>
              <li>Specific</li>
              <li>Measurable</li>
              <li>Attainable</li>
              <li>Relevant</li>
              <li>Time-based</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
          <li>Step 4: Set short-term goals to help achieve your long term goal</li>
          <li>Step 5: Create a plan using your notes from step 2 to help you achieve your short term goals.</li>
          <li>Step 6: Stick to your plan and modify it little by little. If done correctly, you will be successful! It doesn't matter if the weight doesn't just fall off. What matters is that you have made the initial steps to be where you want to be!</li>
        </ul>
